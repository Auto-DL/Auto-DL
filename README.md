# Generator

Interface part of Auto-DL. Contains front-end (React) and backend (DJango Rest Framework) servers.
The backend calls the [DLMML API](https://www.github.com/Auto-DL/DLMML) according to the request it recieved.

Generator has DLMML as a submodule.

## How to run

1.  ```sh
    # clone the repo
    git clone https://github.com/Auto-DL/Generator.git
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ```
2. ***Activate your environment** (not compulsory but highly recommended)*

3.  ```sh
    # install the requirements, this might take some time, be patient
    pip install requirements.txt
    ```

4.  ```sh
    # If you think your machine can handle a simulatenous installation of node modules, open another terminal    
    
    cd FrontEndApp
    npm install

    # go grab a cup of coffee, it takes an eternity XD
    ```
5. Place data in the `./DLMML/data` directory

6.  ```sh
    # run the backend 
    # only after all requriements from requirements.txt are installed
    cd BackEndApp
    python manage.py runserver
    # you can ignore any migration warnings
    ```

7.  ```sh
    # finally, run the react frontend
    # on a new terminal tab
    cd FrontEndApp
    npm start
    ```

**Note:**  For detailed instruction on data directory (point 5) please read [DLMML's User Guide](https://github.com/Auto-DL/DLMML/blob/master/docs/userguide.md)
