# Generator

The interface section of Auto-DL contains front-end and back-end servers based on React and Django Rest Framework respectively.
The backend calls the [DLMML API](https://www.github.com/Auto-DL/DLMML) according to the requests it recieves.

Generator has DLMML as a submodule.

## Demo

<br>
<br>

## Setup

1. Install all the necessary libraries and binaries
```sh
sudo ./scripts/install.sh
```

2. Follow the [instructions](#how-to-run) to run `BackEndApp` and `FrontEndApp` locally or Let it RIP!
```sh
./scripts/run.sh
# or you can pass --install to perform both step 1 and 2
./scripts/run.sh --install
```

## How to run

1.  ```sh
    # clone the repo
    git clone https://github.com/Auto-DL/Generator.git
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ```
2. ***Activate your environment** (not necessary but highly recommended).*

3.  ```sh
    # install the requirements, this might take some time, be patient
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  ```sh
    # If you think your machine can handle a simulatenous installation of node modules, open another terminal

    cd FrontEndApp
    npm install

    # go grab a cup of coffee, it takes an eternity XD
    ```
5. Place data in the `./data` directory.

    Your data should be divided into classes for classification, for example, if you're classifying "Cats V/s Dogs", then your `./data` directory would look like:
    ```sh
    data
    └───dogs_and_cats
        ├───test
        │   ├───cats
        │   └───dogs
        └───train
            ├───cats
            └───dogs
    ```

6.  ```sh
    # run the backend
    # only after all requriements from requirements.txt are installed
    cd BackEndApp
    python manage.py runserver
    # you can ignore any migration warnings
    ```

7.  ```sh
    # finally, run the react frontend
    # on a new terminal tab
    cd FrontEndApp/v1-react
    npm start
    ```

**Note:**  For detailed instruction on data directory (point 5) please read [DLMML's User Guide](https://github.com/Auto-DL/DLMML/blob/master/docs/userguide.md).

### Using Docker

Configure the necessary environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` and run `docker-compose up`. This will setup a development server, so instead if you want to setup a production server you can replace the dockerfile context in `docker-compose.yml` for each container to include the production **Dockerfile** instead of **Dockerfile.dev**.

> Note: Before running the production docker containers modify the **nginx** configuration if needed in `nginx/nginx.conf` as the FrontEndApp docker container uses **nginx** in production
