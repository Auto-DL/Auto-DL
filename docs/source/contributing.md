# Contributing Guidelines

!["alt"](/_static/adl_generator.png "account")

Thank you for contributing to this project. We are excited to have you on board.

There are a few guidelines to be kept in mind before contributing.

- Unless it is a very trivial issue, consider raising an issue and getting feedback from other contributors before creating a pull request.
- When raising an issue, make sure you use the appropriate Issue Templates. This will label the issues appropriately, and help us offer our comments on the issue.
- If you are working on an issue or a part of code that can take a substantial amount of your time, request the maintainers to officially assign the issue to you. That way only one person continues to work on one particular issue, and this avoids potential conflicts.
- Make sure you maintain code readability and add appropriate comments to your code. Also, add appropriate commit messages.
- When offering your comments or feedback to other people, make sure to be constructive and polite.

Have fun. Happy coding :nerd_face:
